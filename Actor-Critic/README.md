### A2C approach:
The actor-critic approach is a popular algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL) that combines elements of both value-based methods and policy-based methods. It aims to learn an optimal policy for an agent to maximize its cumulative reward in an environment.

In RL, an agent interacts with an environment in a sequential manner. At each time step, the agent receives an observation from the environment, takes an action, and receives a reward signal as feedback. The goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

The actor-critic approach consists of two main components: the actor and the critic.

1. Actor: The actor is responsible for learning and improving the agent's policy. It directly interacts with the environment by selecting actions based on the current policy. The policy can be either deterministic (outputting a specific action) or stochastic (outputting a probability distribution over actions). The actor's objective is to maximize the expected cumulative reward by adjusting its policy.

2. Critic: The critic is responsible for estimating the value or quality of the actor's policy. It evaluates the policy by estimating the expected cumulative reward given a certain state or state-action pair. The critic uses a value function or a state-action value function (Q-function) to estimate the value. The value function provides a measure of how good it is to be in a particular state or to take a particular action in that state. The critic provides feedback to the actor by estimating the value of the actor's policy and guiding it towards better actions and decisions.

The actor-critic approach combines the strengths of both value-based and policy-based methods. The critic provides a baseline for estimating the quality of the actor's policy, helping to reduce the variance in the learning process. This is particularly useful in environments with high-dimensional or continuous action spaces. The actor, on the other hand, explores the environment and generates new experiences, which are then used by the critic to update its value estimates.
